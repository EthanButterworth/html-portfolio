    <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>My first hobby began watching my Dad play Halo and Shadowrun back in 2007. Soon after a I was given my own Playstation 2, making me more familiar with the cables that came with them than some adults back then. Later on I was upgraded to an Xbox and fell in love with Halo 3, even making some great memories and friends from it.</p>
        <p>In 2014 I got my first PC, built by my Dad with the hopes for a fancy car and a nice retirement home when I made it big as a Youtuber. Owning my own PC and modding games naturally curated a proficiency and interest in IT. I went on to study IT in Highschool and College as well as upgrading my pc then eventually replacing it entirely with one I built myself.</p>
        <p>In Highschool I studied IT, working primarily with Office to create spreadsheets and databases. I also took up computer art as an extra subject, this primarily rotated around Adobe Photoshop. In this class I would normally create my own wallpapers using artwork from the games I played. In my personal time at home I would continue to play with Photoshop, creating more wallpapers, profile pictures as well as entertaining images of myself and friends. I even began creating simple animations using Adobe Photoshop and After Effects.</p>
        <p>In College I studied a BTEC Extended Diploma in IT, I really enjoyed the assignments that involved having to design and build something. For one, I had to creative an interactive learning application including interactive buttons, embedded images and a video. Another had me creating a flash animation. Then another my own website using HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h2>Outdoors</h2>
        <p> From a young age my mum and close family have always made a point to get out of the house for walks and picnics. Because of this, I have a love for nature and the peace it brings.</p>
        <p>Theres nothing I enjoy more then going to a park or farm with my younger siblings, nephews/nieces and pets. Their joy is always infectious and keeping up with them is tiring, nothing beats a good day out, nice food and an early night.</p>
        <p> Hiking is a more recent hobby Ive taken up, Im hoping hoping to make wild camping a frequent occurance to continue getting out of the house and enjoying time away from the couch with mates.</p>

    <h2>Gym</h2>
        <pc>Over the last year I have started the gym. Inconsistently in the past but in the last few months I have made my own routine im sticking with. I go on the way home from work and have found it to be extremely beneficial to not only my physical but mental health also.</pc>
